# FirstPass - A Password Generator built with Flet
## Description
This is repository for firstpass.fly.dev which serves as an open source password generator web app, an alternative to the ones provided by LastPass and BitWarden.
## Required Libraries
- Flet (imported as ft into main.py)
- Random
- String
## How to Run Yourself
Simply run main.py and a local server will be created if the Flet library is imported.
## How it Works
Main.py uses the Flet library to generate the UI for the web app with each element being generated into its own view and passgen.py generates both passphrases and passwords to be used.
